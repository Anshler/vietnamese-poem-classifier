# Vietnamese poem classification and evaluation üìúüîç

A Vietnamese poem classifer using [BertForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/trituenhantaoio/bert-base-vietnamese-uncased) with the accuracy of ```99.7%```

This is a side project during the making of our [Vietnamese poem generator](https://github.com/Anshler/poem_generator)

## Features

* Classify Vietnamese poem into categories of ```4 chu```, ```5 chu```, ```7 chu```, ```luc bat``` and ```8 chu```
* Score the quality of each poem, based soldly on its conformation to the rigid rule of various types of Vietnamese poem. Using 3 criterias: Length, Tone and Rhyme as follow: ```score = L/10 + 3T/10 + 6R/10```

The rules for each genre are defined below:

|------------------|------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 4 chu    | - 4 words per line <br>- 4 lines per stanza (optional) | For each line: <br>- If the 2nd word is uneven (tr·∫Øc), the 4th word is even (b·∫±ng) <br>- Vice versa | Last word (4th) of each line: <br>- Continuous rhyme (gieo v·∫ßn ti·∫øp) <br>- Alternating rhyme (gieo v·∫ßn tr√©o) <br>- Three-line rhyme (gieo v·∫ßn ba)|
