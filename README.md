# Vietnamese poem classifier and evaluator üìúüîç

A Vietnamese poem classifer using [BertForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/trituenhantaoio/bert-base-vietnamese-uncased) with the accuracy of ```99.7%```

This is a side project during the making of our [Vietnamese poem generator](https://github.com/Anshler/poem_generator)

## Features

* Classify Vietnamese poem into categories of ```4 chu```, ```5 chu```, ```7 chu```, ```luc bat``` and ```8 chu```
* Score the quality of each poem, based soldly on its conformation to the rigid rule of various types of Vietnamese poem. Using 3 criterias: Length, Tone and Rhyme as follow: ```score = L/10 + 3T/10 + 6R/10```

The rule for each genre is as followed:

| Genre | Rule |
|------------------|------------------|
| 4 chu    | - Length: 4 words per line, 4 lines per stanza (optional) <br>- Tone: for each line, if the 2nd word is uneven (tr·∫Øc), the 4th word is even (b·∫±ng), and vice versa <br>- Rhyme: divided into continuous rhyme (gieo v·∫ßn ti·∫øp), alternating rhyme (gieo v·∫ßn tr√©o) and three-line rhyme (gieo v·∫ßn ba) for the last word of each line|
| 5 chu    | - Length: 5 words per line, 4 lines per stanza (optional)  <br>- Tone and Rhyme: same as "4 chu" |
| 7 chu    | - Length: 7 words per line, 4 lines per stanza (optional) <br>- Tone: for each line, if the 2nd word is uneven (tr·∫Øc), the 4th word is even (b·∫±ng), the 6th word is uneven (tr·∫Øc), and vice versa <br>- 5th word and last word (7th) must have different tone <br>- Rhyme: the last word of 1st, 2nd, 4th line per stanza must have same tone and rhyme |
| luc bat    | - Length: 6 words in odd line, 8 words in even line, 4 lines per stanza (optional) <br>- Tone: for 6-word line, if the 2nd word is uneven (tr·∫Øc) the 4th word is even (b·∫±ng), the 6th word is uneven (tr·∫Øc), the following 8-word line must be the same, the last word (8th) mut have same tone as 6th word <br>- Rhyme: the last word (6th) in 6-word line must rhyme with the 6th word in the next 8-word line, as well as the 8th word in the previous 8-word line |
| 8 chu    | - Length: 8 words per line, 4 lines per stanza (optional)    |
